## Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: SharpResults is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into your existing projects.
- **Type-Safe Error Handling**: Implement the Result pattern to handle errors without exceptions.
- **Fluent API**: Enjoy a clean and intuitive API for handling results.
- **Functional Programming Support**: Use functional programming concepts to enhance your code quality.
- **Monads**: Work with monads to manage side effects and improve code clarity.

## Installation

You can easily add SharpResults to your project via NuGet. Use the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package SharpResults
```

Alternatively, you can search for "SharpResults" in the NuGet Package Manager within Visual Studio.

## Usage

Using SharpResults is straightforward. Below is a simple example to get you started.

### Basic Example

```csharp
using SharpResults;

public class Example
{
    public Result<int> Divide(int numerator, int denominator)
    {
        if (denominator == 0)
        {
            return Result.Fail<int>("Cannot divide by zero.");
        }
        
        return Result.Ok(numerator / denominator);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Divide` method returns a `Result<int>`. If the denominator is zero, it returns a failure result with an error message.

### Handling Results

You can easily handle results using the `OnSuccess` and `OnFailure` methods:

```csharp
var result = new Example().Divide(10, 0);

result.OnSuccess(value => Console.WriteLine($"Result: {value}"))
      .OnFailure(error => Console.WriteLine($"Error: {error}"));
```

This approach allows you to manage success and failure states clearly.

## Examples

### Chaining Results

SharpResults supports chaining, allowing you to create a sequence of operations:

```csharp
var result = new Example()
    .Divide(10, 2)
    .OnSuccess(value => new Example().Divide(value, 2));

result.OnSuccess(value => Console.WriteLine($"Final Result: {value}"))
      .OnFailure(error => Console.WriteLine($"Error: {error}"));
```

### Combining Results

You can also combine multiple results into a single result:

```csharp
var result1 = new Example().Divide(10, 2);
var result2 = new Example().Divide(20, 4);

var combinedResult = Result.Combine(result1, result2);

combinedResult.OnSuccess(() => Console.WriteLine("Both operations succeeded."))
              .OnFailure(error => Console.WriteLine($"Error: {error}"));
```
